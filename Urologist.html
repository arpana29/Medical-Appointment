<p>Urologists practice a type of medicine called urology. They specialize in treating conditions of the male and female urinary tract. That includes all organs and other body parts along the path urine takes out of the body. Those organs are:

Bladder
Kidneys
Ureters -- tubes that take urine from the kidneys to the bladder
Urethra -- the duct that urine comes out of (In men, semen also comes out of the urethra.)
Urologists also treat male sex organs, including the penis, prostate, scrotum, and testes (testicles).
