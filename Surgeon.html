</head>
<body> 
<p>a surgeon is a physician who performs surgery. There are also surgeons in podiatry, dentistry, and veterinary medicine. It is estimated that surgeons perform over 300 million surgical procedures globally each year.
</p> All surgeons are physicians, but not all physicians are surgeons!

A surgeon is able to remove diseased tissue or organs, repair body systems, or replace diseased organs with transplants. Surgeons can be general surgeons and perform all types of surgery, or they can be specialized, such as heart surgeons, brain surgeons, dentists, or veterinarians.
