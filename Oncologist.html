Oncology is the study of cancer. An oncologist is a doctor who treats cancer and provides medical care for a person diagnosed with cancer. An oncologist may also be called a cancer specialist.

The field of oncology has 3 major areas based on treatments: medical oncology, radiation oncology, and surgical oncology.

Medical oncologists treat cancer using medication, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy.

Radiation oncologists treat cancer using radiation therapy, which is the use of high-energy x-rays or other particles to destroy cancer cells.

Surgical oncologists treat cancer using surgery, including removing the tumor and nearby tissue during a operation. This type of surgeon can also perform certain types of biopsies to help diagnose cancer.
